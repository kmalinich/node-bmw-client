The sideview mirror selector switch on the left door armrest will send these messages: (Thanks saft6luck) I will use this message to turn on rearview camera

9B 04 51    6D 40 E3 // right
9B 04 51    6D 80 23 // left

saft6luck: "For my LH driven car the 0x9B is the left and 0x51 is the right mirror module. Btw. I duno if this changes for the RH driven car. The mirrors are controlled by these modules and the buttons are read in by the 0x9B module in my case."



When key is inserted into the ignition lock these messages are sent. I will use this to detect ignition on.

> GT --> IKE : Ignition status request  (Jochen)

Answer:
80 04 BF 11 03 29

80 = IKE
04 = length
BF = Global
11 = Ignition status
03 = Data
29 = checksum

Data: (bit mapped)
Bit 1 = KL_R (Pos1_Acc)
Bit 2 = KL_15 (Pos2_On)
Bit 3 = KL_50 (Pos3_Start)



When gear is put in reverse and ignition is on these messages are sent: (Thanks saft6luck) I will use this to turn on rearview camera

Note that the four red marked bytes are really a bitvector. Only the bold one bit is significant for these messages.

80 0A BF 13 02 00 00 00 00 00 38 1C // out

handbrake on
oil pressure low
brake pads worn
transmission emergency program
gearbox not in P
motor running
vehicle driving
reverse not plausible
Gear: R
Gear: 1
Gear: 2
Gear: D
alarm horn on

When a button is pressed on the remote key (#1) these messages are sent. I will use this to start the PC as soon as possible.

00 04 BF 72 22 EB // unlock in

LED control messages (Thanks, Priie and saft6luck) I will use this to indicate System Status



Ex.
C8h 04h E7h 2Bh DB1 crc

DB1 is controlling the LEDs:

DB1: bit
76 54 32 10
00 gg yy rr

00: off
01: on
11: on/flashing

The LEDs are for the telephone connection - all three will blink for the Bluetooth
pairing, I don't know if they blink for hardwired phone, the right LED is red, and
blinks if there is NO cell coverage on the connected phone. The middle LED is
green and lights up when you have active connection on the phone.

Indicator lamps for phone* mode
Yellow: Call is being routed through alternate network
Green: Call is connected
Red: Phone not available
Flashes: Phone is not registered with a service provider
Please consult the separate manual for instructions on operating the
telephone. http://www.e38. org/BMW_nav_ owners_manual200 4.pdf




Turning on an off LED next to left knob  (Thank you Saft6luck). I will use this to indicate PC up and running


"For the LED on the left button: it is indicating the status of the
radio (on/off), at least for my LHD 16:9 board monitor.

You can use message 0x4A, e.g. 0x68 LL 0xF0 0x4A 0xFF CS to switch it
on and DB1=0x00 to switch it off."



Speed (Thank you, Richard Gaunt) I will use this to create PWM for the GPS

80 05 BF 18 ss rr cc

ss = speed / 2 [km/h] (512km/h max)
rr = revs / 100 rpm



Set Time (thanks enforcer) I might use this to set car time from PC/GPS time.

GT telling IKE to set the time:

3B 06 80 40 01 0C 3B cc
GT –> IKE : On-board computer set data: Set Time = 12:59
40 = OBC  Set data
01 = Time
0C = hours in hex
3B = minutes in hex

GT telling IKE to set the date:

3B 07 80 40 02 1B 05 08 cc
GT –> IKE : On-board computer set data: Set Date = 27/05/08
40 = OBC Set data
02 = Date
1B = day in hex
05 = month in hex
08 = year in hex

80 BF 15 F1 00 00 00
IKE  --> GLO : Country coding status: Ntwk=E46 Lang=GB_English Clock=24h OutTemp=°C AvgSpd=km/h Limit=km Dist=km ArrTime=24h Consump=l/100_km Motor=Petrol



Set units on IKE

To change country coding, first tell the IKE what it should be
The IKE then does the job of telling everyone else.

Here is an E46 that just changed km to miles:
3B 80 15 F1 70 10 00
GT --> IKE : Country coding status: Ntwk=E46 Lang=GB_English Clock=24h OutTemp=°C AvgSpd=mph Limit=mls Dist=mls ArrTime=12h Motor=Petrol

So it uses the same country coding status, but the GT sends the info to the IKE
80 BF 15 01 00

change OBC temp to C, 24H time, MPG

80 BF 15 01 01  change OBC temp to C, 12H time, KM/L
80 BF 15 01 02  change OBC temp to F, 24H time, L/100km
80 BF 15 01 03  change OBC temp to F, 12H time, US MPG
80 BF 15 01 04  change OBC temp to C, 24H time, MPG
80 BF 15 01 05  change OBC temp to C, 12H time, KM/L
80 BF 15 01 06  change OBC temp to F, 24H time, L/100KM
80 BF 15 01 07  change OBC temp to F, 12H time, US MPG
80 BF 15 01 08  change OBC temp to C, 24H time, MPG
80 BF 15 01 09  change OBC temp to C, 12H time, KM/L

I think this is 2 x different unit values: one for Cons1 and one for Cons2
but nav applies same settings to Consumpt1 and Consumpt2

eg:
xxxx xx00 Consumpt.1 L/100
xxxx xx01 Consumpt.1 MPG
xxxx xx11 Consumpt.1 KM/L

xxxx 00xx Consumpt.2 L/100
xxxx 01xx Consumpt.2 MPG
xxxx 11xx Consumpt.2 KM/L


DB4:
bit 0 motor type 0=petrol, 1=Diesel
