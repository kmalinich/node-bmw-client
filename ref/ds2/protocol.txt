The DS2 protocol consists of groups of two-digit hexidecimal bytes sent and received in the following format:

[Address] [Length] [Data1] [Data2] ... [Data n] [Checkum]

[Address]  The address of the module being queried
[Length]   Total number of bytes in the message (in hex)
[Data]     One or more bytes which comprise either the command (from you) or the response (from the module)
[Checksum] is an XOR checksum, based on all of the preceding bytes. This serves as basic error correction.

Address examples:
00 (body/general module)
12 (Bosch DME)
80 (instrument cluster)

Messages from the scanner to the car's modules consist of the module address, the number of bytes, a command, and a checksum.

For example, the scanner might send the following:
"12 05 04 01 12"

This command asks the Bosch DME (12), in a 5-byte message (05), to send codes (04 01).
The 12 is a checksum.

The module response uses the same format.
The address is typically the modules's own address, then the length byte, and then one of the following:

A0 (acknowledge)
A1 (module busy)
FF (no acknowledge -- bad command, etc.)

Followed by data.

For example, in response to a request for fault codes, the ECU might respond with the following:
"12 06 A0 00 00 B4"

12    - The address
06    - Number of bytes
A0    - Acknowledge
00 00 - Number of codes stored
B4    - Checksum
