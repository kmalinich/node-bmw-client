00 -- ECU Identification

This command requests the module to return a string of information about itself.

Example: "12 04 00 16"
Tells the Motronic module (address = 12) to send information about itself.
(The "04" means four bytes in the message, and "16" is the checksum.)

The information returned varies among the different modules, but in many cases, the first seven digits that the module returns (after the headers) is a partial BMW part number for that module.
In the case of the Motronic ECU, the data returned must be converted from hex to ASCII to be read.


04 01 -- Check fault codes

This command causes the module to return a string containing the number of fault codes, followed by the numbers of the codes.

Example: "12 05 04 01 12"
Tells the Motronic ECU to send any fault codes.


04 nn -- Check specific fault code
Once you have the number, you can get more information about one specific fault by using its number.


05 -- Clear trouble codes

Once the problem has been corrected, codes can be cleared with this command
Example: "12 04 05 [cs]"

9F = diagnostic end
9E = diagnostic mode enable and wait tester
53 = read supplier ID
0B = read car coded data, read IO-status
09 = write car coded data
31 = test program download
32 = test program start
